  The ISO/TMB has appointed https://www.sis.se[SIS] to operate the newly established
  "ISO/TC 211 Harmonized Resources Maintenance Agency" that will serve as the
  governance umbrella of all ISO/TC 211 managed resources.

The ISO Technical Management Board has approved the establishment of the
"ISO/TC 211 Harmonized Resources Maintenance Agency", originally proposed by
https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc211/home/resolutions.html[ISO/TC 211 CIB Resolution 2021-16],
"Terms of reference for the Maintenance Agency for the ISO/TC 211 Harmonized Resources for Implementation".

The https://www.sis.se[Swedish Institute of Standards (SIS)] has been appointed as the ISO/TC 211
Harmonized Resources Maintenance Agency ("HRMA"), being the current Secretariat
for ISO/TC 211. https://www.ribose.com[Ribose], as the current technology provider for hosting ISO/TC
211 resources, will continue to provide platform support to the newly
established Maintenance Agency in accordance with https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc211/home/resolutions.html[ISO/TC 211 Resolution 912].

The ISO/TC 211 harmonized resources are resources published at
https://www.isotc211.org, meant to assist developers, implementers and users of
ISO/TC 211 standards, including UML models, XML schemas and ontologies.

Since the management of these harmonized resources require specialized
governance and information system support, it is necessary to adopt a
governance structure that is different from the typical standards lifecycle
as described in the https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/consolidated/index.xhtml[ISO Directives].

The establishment of the HRMA as an ISO Maintenance Agency (MA) (in accordance
with ISO Directives Part 1, Annex G), was proposed by the ISO/TC 211 Secretariat
in conjunction with AG 2 Strategy as a solution compatible with the ISO
Directives in handling governance processes needed by the harmonized resources.

The ISO/TC 211 HRMA is a bold effort that allows the management of digital and
machine-readable resources associated with all ISO/TC 211 published standards,
and provides a solid basis for new ISO/TC 211 standards in the years to come.
